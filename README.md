# is31fl3205
A rust-embedded driver for the Lumissil Microsystems IS31FL3205 LED driver

- https://crates.io/crates/is31fl3205

## description
The IS31FL3205 is an LED driver with 12 constant current channels. Each channel can be pulse width modulated (PWM) by 16 bits for smooth LED brightness control. In addition, each channel has an 8-bit output current control register which allows fine tuning the current for rich RGB color mixing, e.g., a pure white color LED application. The maximum output current of each channel can be adjusted by one 8-bit global control register.

Proprietary programmable algorithms are used in IS31FL3205 to minimize audible noise caused by the MLCC decoupling capacitor. All registers can be programmed via a high speed I2C (1MHz).
IS31FL3205 can be turned off with minimum current consumption by either pulling the SDB pin low or by using the software shutdown feature.
IS31FL3205 is available in QFN-20 (3mm × 3mm) package. It operates from 2.7V to 5.5V over the temperature range of -40°C to +125°C.

## example
Examples are based on the `stm32h7xx_hal`.

```rust
// Initialize a delay provider
let mut delay: Delay = Delay::new(cp.SYST, ccdr.clocks);

// Initialize I2C pins, SCL, SDA
let scl = scl
    .into_alternate_af4()
    .internal_pull_up(true)
    .set_open_drain();
let sda = sda
    .into_alternate_af4()
    .internal_pull_up(true)
    .set_open_drain();

// Initialize the Enable line
let en = en.into_push_pull_output();

// Initialize 
let i2c: stm32h7xx_hal::i2c::I2c<I2C1> =
    i2c.i2c((scl, sda), 1.MHz(), prec, clocks);

// Initialize with blocking I2C for device at address 0x00
let mut interface = Is31fl3205::init_with_i2c(0x00, i2c, en);

// Enable the device, bringing the enable line high and configuring
// the oscillator clock, pwm resolution
interface.enable_device(
    delay,
    OscillatorClock::SixteenMHz,
    PwmResolution::SixteenBit,
    SoftwareShutdownMode::Normal,
)
.unwrap();

// Set maximum current drain as specified by the current resistance
interface.set_global_current(0xFF).unwrap();

// Set brightness scaling for all leds
interface.set_all_led_scaling(0xFF).unwrap();

/// Finally set the first LED to maximum 16bit brightness. For drivers configured for less than 16bit
/// Only the required bits are used
interface.set(0, 0xFFFF).unwrap()

// Release the blocking i2c example to regain access to its underlying resources
let (_i2c, _en) = color_controller.release();

// Additionally, if you need to integrate this driver with platform specific DMA controllers then
// a flexible callback can be used rather than blocking i2c
static mut DMA_BUFFER: [u8; 3] = [0; 3];
let interface = Is31fl3205::init_with_callback(0x00, en, |addr, data| unsafe {
    // Copy the data from the Is31fl3205 into the DMA buffer for processing
    // NOTE: data can change in size depending on the message, the DMA implementation will
    // need to be able to handle changing slice lengths
    DMA_BUFFER[0..data.len()].copy_from_slice(data);
});
```
